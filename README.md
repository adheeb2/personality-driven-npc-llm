# Personality-Driven NPC with LLM (Ollama + Llama 3.1)

### ðŸŽ­ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **personality-driven AI NPC** using **LLM prompt engineering**. Instead of generic chatbot responses, the NPC stays **in-character** (e.g., a _grumpy blacksmith_ or _cheerful bard_) across conversations.

By combining **Python**, **Ollama**, and the **Llama 3.1 model**, the NPC generates dialogue that feels consistent, immersive, and suitable for **game development**, **interactive storytelling**, and **conversational AI experiments**.

### ðŸš€ Features

- **Fixed Personality NPCs** â€“ lock an NPC into roles like blacksmiths, bards, or shopkeepers.
- **Prompt Engineering** â€“ design character voices and ensure consistency in dialogue.
- **Local LLM Integration** â€“ powered by **Ollama** running **Llama 3.1**, no cloud dependency.
- **Python API Calls** â€“ uses `requests` to handle player input and NPC responses.
- **Immersive Dialogue** â€“ in-character answers, roleplay-friendly output.

### ðŸ§  Skills Gained

- Prompt engineering basics (zero-shot templates for role consistency).
- Character voice design and NPC roleplay.
- LLM integration with Ollama (local inference).
- Input/output sanitization for cleaner player interactions.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

- **Game Development** â€“ drop believable NPCs into RPGs or interactive novels.
- **Prototyping** â€“ experiment with **LLM-powered dialogue systems** without heavy frameworks.
- **Conversational AI** â€“ practice designing role-locked agents with personality.
